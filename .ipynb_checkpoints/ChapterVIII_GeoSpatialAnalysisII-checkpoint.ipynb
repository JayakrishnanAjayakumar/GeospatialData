    "## Why do we use rasters?\n",
    "\n",
    "We generally use rasters to map continuos data (for example population, weather, air quality etc). For example suppose we have airquality monitors that capture various air quality indicators such as the amount of PM2.5, CO, or other particulate matters. Normally a City/Corporation would install them in some key areas such as near factories, or heavy traffic zones etc. \n",

    "![raster4](images/raster4.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can see that our plot is in an area of high values. We can take the average value for the cells that interesects with the plot (.82).\n",
    "\n",
    "But how do we generate this raster?\n",
    "\n",
    "We use a technique called **spatial interpolation**, which is based on the property of spatial autocorrelation. We will cover spatial interpolation and spatial autocorrelation in the next chapter. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have such a surface with values ,we can find out values for any vector (points,lines or polygons) that falls with in the area covered by the raster. \n",
