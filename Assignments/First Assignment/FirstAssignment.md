# Load your own Geospatial data to GIS
Download spatial data (in shapefile format) from any available online source (even better, if its about something that interests you) and load it to QGIS (you can try it out in Python as well). 
Copy the shapefile along with the required files (shapefile is a combination of files) to the First Assignment folder. 
You can drag and drop the files to the folder or upload it using the upload files option. Also take a screen shot of the dataset loaded to QGIS and save it to the assignments folder as an image. 
If you are trying it out in Python, create a new notebook file in this folder and add the code that reads the shapefile from this folder itself.
