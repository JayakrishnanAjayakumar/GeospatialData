# Putting Addresses to Map
In this Assignment we will use geocoding to convert a dataset of addresses to spatial data. 

Download the dataset (CSV file) from https://cwru.box.com/s/iqs8tsqaofafz6anwf4fasdtxwumle4p
Geocode it using MMQGIS Plugin in (QGIS)

Run OpenStreetMap Geocoder and Census Geocoder and compare the results (how many geocoded and how many not). You can include the counts in a text file or word file and upload to this folder

Upload the results to QGIS, and add a reference map. Take two seperate screenshots for each of the results from the geocoder. Upload both the shapefiles to this folder

Take any of the shapefile and check its projection. Mention that in the text file you are uploading.Now reproject it to Psuedo-Mercator Projection (ESG:3857). Upload the resulting shapefile to this folder.
