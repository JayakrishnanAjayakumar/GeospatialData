Create different heatmaps for each datasets. Use a bandwidth (radius) of 2500m and cell size of 100m. 

Each heatmap should be overlaid on top of a basemap (heatmap transparency should be modified). Take screenshot of the heatmap along with basemap.

In a text file include comments (which is the highest/lowest, increasing/decreasing etc) for each of the heatmaps.
