    "\n",
    "#### Proximity Interpolation\n",
    "\n",
    "This is probably the **simplest (and possibly one of the oldest) interpolation method**. The process is simple, **assign all un-sampled locations the value of the closest sampled location**. \n",
    "\n",
    "**This generates a tessellated surface whereby lines that split the midpoint between each sampled location are connected thus enclosing an area. This is called Voronoi Polygon or Thiessen Polygon. Each area ends up enclosing a sample point whose value it inherits.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**One problem with this approach is that the surface values change abruptly across the tessellated boundaries. This is not representative of most surfaces in nature.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though we won't be covering this interpolation algorithm in detail, let's try it out for fun. For this experiment, we will be using snow depth data from Utah\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download the data from https://cwru.box.com/s/nn4lr5y3fsnth17lgwrlm0qv1kefw50h\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Load the data to QGIS\n",
    "\n",
    "![admethod14](images/admethod14.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Select Vector Geometry from toolbox and select Voronoi Polygons\n",
    "\n",
    "![admethod15](images/admethod15.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Now select input layer as the snow depth data and click run. \n",
    "\n",
    "![admethod16](images/admethod16.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. You will get a set of Polygons as output. If you examine the Attribute table, each of them will have all the attributes as the snow depth data.\n",
    "\n",
    "![admethod17](images/admethod17.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "For proximity interpolation, if you want to check the value for a new location, you find the polygon in which it resides and then assign the value for the new location as the value assignd to the polygon.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method does not create a smooth surface of values, but rather create polygons, which might have abrupt changes in value. Now let us try an interpolation method that generates smooth surface based on bandwidth."

    "#### Inverse Distance Weighted Interpolation (IDW)\n",
    "\n",
    "**The IDW technique computes an average value for un-sampled locations using values from nearby weighted locations**. The **weights are proportional to the proximity of the sampled points to the un-sampled location and can be specified by the IDW power coefficient**. The larger the power coefficient, the stronger the weight of nearby points. \n",

    "Where <b>z<sub>p</sub></b> is the unknown value to be estimated at a new position. i from 1 to n represents the neighbors for the location. <b>z<sub>i</sub></b> is the value at the <b>i</b>th neighbor of the new location. <b>d<sub>i</sub><sup>p</sup></b> is the distance of the new location from the <b>i th</b> location raised to a power <b>p</b>. Generally we take <b>p</b> as 2. As the power increases the influence by local nearby values increases. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try IDW using the same snow depth dataset for Utah\n",
    "\n",
    "##### IDW in action\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load the snow depth dataset to QGIS\n",
