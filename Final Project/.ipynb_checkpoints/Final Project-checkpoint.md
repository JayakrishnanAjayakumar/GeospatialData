4) 	Create a professional map for city of Cleveland with parcels having more than 10 positive covid cases for   elderly people (age 60 and above) with in them. The matching parcel polygon should be colored red. Also take a screenshot of the final attribute table.

5)  Create two different professional map for total test positivity rate (total positive/total tests) and sovi score for the census tracts with in the City of Cleveland (for SOVI score use RPL_THEMES..higher the value higher the vulnerability). Align them side by side for a visual comparison

6)  Create a professional map of SOVI scores for the ZIP polygons in Cleveland. As SOVI data is not available for ZIP codes, you have to use the SOVI raster grid to assign SOVI scores for the ZIP.

             And finally
             Between 2022-02-01to2022-02-05.tif and 2020-05-01to2020-08-01.tif
